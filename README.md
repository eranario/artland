The overarching aim is to create a vision-based landmark with a unique ID that can be tied to an absolute location by developing a program that allows visual sensors to identify the landmarksâ€™ locations with respect to its relative distance and angle. The final product will replace the functions of a navigational unit in areas with limited access to GPS signals.
